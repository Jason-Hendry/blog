## Success at First - 2015-11-06

As with most project the first 2-3 weeks are simple and easy to manage.
After that however as you start to hit road blocks this project is
Starting to slow

## Project Stalled - 2015-11-30

After 2 weeks into a new job no work has been completed. Currently I have 11 Open tasks

### Problems Identified

* Too Tired
* New Job is excuse to not work
* Nothing is really functioning to a point were data can be added
* Client (My Wife) is not interested or pushing for work to continue

### Solutions

* Identify Small pieces to build momentum again
* Same solution - avoid long evening of work
* Add all outstanding tasks to YouTrack and identify functional components
* Get a staging site live for early evaluation
